## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aksh0393/spring-boot-consul-connect.git
cd spring-boot-consul-connect
```

### Build the Project
```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Configuration
Configuration properties for the application can be found in the `application.yml` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory. You can configure the Consul host, port, and other settings in this file.

## Endpoints
The application exposes the following endpoints:

```bash

After running Consul, you can access the Consul UI at `http://localhost:8500`.

```
## Run the Application
You can run the Spring Boot application using the following command:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Alternatively, you can build a JAR file and run it:
```bash
mvn clean package
java -jar target/spring-boot-consul-connect-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
